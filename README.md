## Cloning and editing the project

This project uses GradleRIO, the Gradle-based FRC toolchain. You can read more about GradleRIO [here](https://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO).

To clone the project, first clone it into your working directory with ```git clone``` or the GitHub Desktop app.

Then generate the project files for your IDE:
- ```gradlew idea``` (IntelliJ IDEA)
- ```gradlew eclipse``` (Eclipse)

IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse both have native support for Gradle.

## Building and deploying your code
- ```gradlew clean``` will clean your build directories
- ```gradlew build``` will build your Robot Code
- ```gradlew deploy``` will deploy your built code to the RoboRIO
- These tasks must be run in succession.

If you're lazy, just use this command: ```gradlew clean build deploy```

These tasks are also listed in the Gradle window in IntelliJ IDEA, or the Gradle Tasks window in Eclipse.
You can even create run configurations to execute these tasks!

## Pushing to GitHub

To push your updates to GitHub, simply use ```git push``` or the Github Desktop app.

*Make sure that the project files generated by your IDE are not being tracked by Git!*
